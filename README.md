This repository demonstrates a common error when working with raw pointers in Rust, specifically with vectors.  The `bug.rs` file showcases unsafe code that modifies the vector's contents directly through its raw pointer. This can lead to undefined behavior if the vector's internal structure is changed after obtaining the pointer. The `bugSolution.rs` file demonstrates a safer alternative using vector's built-in methods.
